# Project Title

The famous Paper Rock Scissors game as part of a hiring process under TTD.

# Deployment

You can visit the deployed website [here](https://paper-rock-scissors.netlify.com/).

# Running the tests

After you fork the repository, run `yarn init` in your Terminal and make sure you are in the project folder. Then run `yarn add webpack webpack-cli babel-loader babel-preset-env babel-polyfill babel-register --dev`. That should install all the necessary dependencies on your computer.

Then, from your Terminal go to the project folder and run `yarn cucumber`.

During the time we were building the project we saw that cucumber is a bit unreliable at times. Although all scenarios/tests are passing, do not be surprised if you run them and encounter failures. The codebase is solid and the files around the index.html work as expected.

# Tested with
[YARN](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn) - Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management.

[CUCUMBER](https://cucumber.io/) - Tools & techniques that elevate teams to greatness.
